# KTSE

## Introduction
- MA final project for Game category
- Team of 5: Alfie, Charlene, Chris, Julian, Tom
- Our project focus is to come up with a well-designed game, as opposed to focusing on learning new technology or coming out with a polished marketable product.

## Game Concept
**Katsu-to-SpaceEx (KTSE)*** is a strategic survival simulation (SSS) game where a player must complete a 12-cycle educational bootcamp course to secure the best job possible. Each cycle, the player has a set number of Action Points (AP) to perform actions which will influence their Energy level (EL) and/or Project Quality (PQ). 
- EL must remain above 0 for the player to continue playing and the lower the EL, the higher the AP cost is to perform actions. 
- The higher the PQ, the better the job the player secures  at the end of the game.
- The player must manage random events and decision-points which will affect them in various ways.
- The player can interact with Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) who may, within limits, offer bonus effects to support the playerâ€™s performance.

KTSE has been developed using the following technologies*:
- Primary Language: C#
- SDK: Xcode
- IDE: [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/mac/)
- Test Framework: MSTest (in-built with VS)
- Development Platform: [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/)
- Game Framework: [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/about/)

## Project Approach
### Project Kick Off
- Brainstorming (generated 6 ideas)
- Voting - round 1 (down-selected to 3 ideas)
- Define high-level MVP (improve understanding)
- Voting - round 2 (down-selected to 1 idea)
- Define overarching game concept (objective, features, high level mechanics)
- Refine MVP

### Deciding the Tech Stack
- Online research
- Seeking advice from coaches
- Seeking advice from MA alumni
- Seeking advice from expert game developers

Given our lack of experience with any of these technologies / frameworks, we made team decisions based on the information and inputs from these sources. To prevent "decision paralysis", we decided to go for it and understand the risk that if the technologies are not right for us, we may need to change these.

In particular, we decided on:
- **C#** because it is one of the most popular langauges for creating games
- **MonoGame** because using engines such as Unity or Unreal would largely reduce any coding to configuration
